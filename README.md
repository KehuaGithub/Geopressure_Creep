# Geopressure_Creep
This model predicts the pore pressure distribution in geological sediment including creep effect.

This model simulates the processes of sediment deposition from the seafloor and the sediment burial and compaction below the seafloor, and predicts the pore pressure evolution within the sediment. Pore pressure within the sediment increases due to compaction and decreases due to pore water flow. Therefore, the two controlling parameters for pore pressure are sedimentation rate and sediment permeability. Besides, this model simulates the creep effect, where pore pressure increases with time under undrained condition (closed system) and sediment porosity decreases with time under drained condition (open system). 

Detailed description of this model and the creep effect can be found in the following paper:
